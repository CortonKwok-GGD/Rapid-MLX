/// Two paths, both delegating to the proven CLI so the app never
/// reimplements the benchmark or the submission wire format:
///   * ``run`` → `rapid-mlx bench <alias>` (freeform), parses the
///     `Throughput: N tok/s` summary line for display.
///   * ``submit`` → `rapid-mlx bench <alias> --submit` (the
///     standardized B=1 community runner that POSTs to
///     rapidmlx.com/api/benchmarks). The CLI asks for a y/N consent on
///     stdin; the app shows its OWN consent first, then pipes "y" so the
///     user only answers once.
///
/// Both paths are multi-minute for a large model — a cold model load
/// plus (for submit) a full standardized short+long workload. The CLI
/// emits little incremental output, so a plain spinner reads as "hung".
/// We stream the child's stdout to advance a coarse stage label, run a
/// one-second ticker for a live elapsed clock, and show a size-derived
/// ETA so the user knows roughly how long to wait. The elapsed clock is
/// the source of truth; the ETA is an estimate that gracefully degrades
/// to "almost there…" once a slow Mac blows past it.
