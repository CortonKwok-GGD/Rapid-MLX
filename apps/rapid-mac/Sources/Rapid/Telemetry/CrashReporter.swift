/// Catches crashes that escape the Swift runtime and surfaces them
/// as ``error`` events on the next launch.
///
/// We cover three crash classes, in decreasing order of fidelity:
///
///   1. **Uncaught Objective-C exceptions** —
///      ``NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler`` fires on the main thread
///      before AppKit aborts. Heap-safe; we capture the full reason
///      + symbolicated call stack.
///   2. **Fatal signals** (SIGABRT from ``fatalError`` / Swift
///      precondition / ``assert``, plus SIGSEGV / SIGBUS / SIGILL
///      / SIGFPE). Signal handlers run in an interrupted context
///      where heap allocation and most Foundation calls are
///      undefined — so we only ``write(2)`` a tiny pre-allocated
///      marker file and re-raise. The marker tells the next launch
///      "we crashed with signal N at time T."
///   3. **Unclean shutdowns** — a "started" marker is written
///      synchronously on launch and deleted on clean ``terminate``.
///      Anything still on disk next launch that doesn't match
///      classes 1 or 2 is reported as an unclean shutdown. False-
///      positive on force-quit / OS reboot is acceptable; the goal
///      is "we'd rather over-report than miss a v0.5.9-class
///      silent abort."
///
/// On next launch, ``flushPendingCrashReports`` reads the marker
/// directory, sends one ``error`` event per file, and deletes the
/// file on a successful POST. Files that fail to send stay on disk
/// for the launch after that — best-effort retry, no exponential
/// backoff.
///
/// **Signal-safety contract (issue #24).** The signal handler runs
/// in an interrupted context where malloc, stdio, NSObject, Swift
/// reference counting, and most Foundation calls are undefined. We
/// uphold the contract by:
///
///   * Installing handlers via ``sigaction(2)`` with a pure-C
///     handler from the ``RapidCrashHandler`` target (F1) — no
///     Swift trampoline, no captures, no thunks.
///   * Pre-allocating every byte the handler writes — the marker
///     path C string and the 5 per-signal JSON envelopes are
///     ``malloc``'d at install time and handed to the C arena as
///     raw ``UnsafePointer<CChar>`` + length (F2).
///   * Reading state through a pure-C extern struct, not Swift
///     statics — ``_swift_beginAccess`` is async-signal-unsafe.
///   * Guarding the rich-marker-already-written check with
///     ``volatile sig_atomic_t`` (F7) — the only race-safe type the
///     C standard guarantees for the writer/handler boundary.
