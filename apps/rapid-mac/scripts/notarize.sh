# notarize.sh — submit an artifact to Apple's notary service, wait for

# verifiable offline.
#
#   notarize.sh <submit-file> <staple-target>
#
#     submit-file    file uploaded to notarytool. notarytool only accepts
#                    .zip / .dmg / .pkg — to notarise a bare .app, zip it
#                    first (`ditto -c -k --keepParent Rapid.app Rapid.zip`)
#                    and submit the zip.
#     staple-target  what the ticket is stapled to. `stapler` can staple a
#                    .app or a .dmg (NOT a .zip). So:
#                      app:  submit Rapid.zip, staple Rapid.app
#                      dmg:  submit Rapid.dmg, staple Rapid.dmg
#
# Why staple the .app AND the .dmg in the release flow: stapling the .app
# (before it goes into the dmg) is what lets the installed app launch on a
# machine that is offline on first run — Gatekeeper reads the embedded
# ticket instead of phoning home. Stapling the .dmg covers the download
# itself. See scripts/dmg.sh + the release workflow for the ordering.
#
# Credentials come from the environment (App Store Connect API key — the
# CI-friendly path, no personal Apple ID / app-specific password):
#   AC_API_KEY_ID      App Store Connect key id
#   AC_API_ISSUER_ID   issuer id (top of the App Store Connect Keys page)
#   AC_API_KEY_PATH    path to the AuthKey_XXX.p8 file
#
# If any are unset we SKIP (exit 0) with a notice — so a local
# `build.sh && dmg.sh` without Apple creds still succeeds; only a real
# release run (which exports these) actually notarises.

# rejects the slim DMG ("must be a zip archive (.zip), flat
# installer package (.pkg), or UDIF disk image (.dmg)") even though
# ``hdiutil verify`` accepts the same bytes as a valid UDIF image
# (suspected interaction between envelope codesign and notarytool's
# end-of-file ``koly`` trailer detector — see rapid-desktop#427).
# --force only skips the LOCAL validator; Apple's server still runs
# the full notarisation pipeline and would reject a truly malformed
# artifact.

# Note: macOS ships Bash 3.2.57; under ``set -u`` the bare expansion
# ``"${FORCE_FLAG[@]}"`` errors as "unbound variable" when the array is
# empty. The ``${name[@]+...}`` guard expands to nothing when the array
# is unset/empty and to the protected expansion otherwise — safe on
# Bash 3.2 and forward-compatible with Bash 4+/5+. Codex r1 BLOCKING.
# Capture submission output so we can extract the id and pull the
# per-issue log on Invalid. ``--output-format json`` makes the parse
# robust without depending on the human-readable layout (which Apple
# has shipped breaking changes to in the past).
#
# IMPORTANT (Apple quirk): under ``--output-format json``, notarytool
# returns exit 0 even when the final status is ``Invalid`` (the exit
# code reflects whether the SUBMISSION succeeded, not the notarization
# verdict — the JSON ``status`` field is the source of truth). Without
# this awareness the script would proceed to ``stapler staple`` on an
# un-notarised image and the slim DMG R2 publish gate would then catch
# the missing staple, but the operator would never see Apple's actual
# reason. We always parse the status and treat anything other than
# ``Accepted`` as failure.
