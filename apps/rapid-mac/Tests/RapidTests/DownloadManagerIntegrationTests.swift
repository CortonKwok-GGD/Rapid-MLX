///
///   * The readability handler hop-back from the IO thread to the
///     ``@MainActor`` actually delivers stderr lines.
///   * ``terminationHandler`` actually fires on real-process exit and
///     transitions the job out of ``.running``.
///   * Pipe / env / stdin-nulldev plumbing matches what the CLI needs.
///   * The subprocess actually finds itself on PATH the way the
