"""Decode-throughput perf-regression gate — measures generation speed against a
REAL running ``rapid-mlx serve`` and (optionally) fails when it drops below a
reviewed floor.

This is the perf half of the release gate that the Tier-1 agent smoke
(``tests/integrations/agent_smoke.sh``) runs on the SAME warm serve it already
booted for the agentic checks — so there is no second model load. Like
``evals/coherence_gate.py`` it requires a server to already be listening (it does
**not** boot one) and reads ``$RAPID_MLX_BASE_URL`` by default.

Why a long, fixed generation
----------------------------
A hybrid MoE model's tokens/sec on a SHORT response is dominated by prefill and
kernel-warmup noise (#284), so a short-prompt measurement is not a reliable
regression signal. This gate uses a short prompt and a LONG generation
(``--max-tokens``, default 512) so decode dominates the wall clock; on a fixed
workload at temperature 0 the end-to-end tokens/sec is a stable proxy for decode
throughput. A small warmup request precedes the measured one so a cold
long-context kernel does not skew the number.

Baseline is a reviewed human decision, never automatic
------------------------------------------------------
This gate NEVER invents a baseline. With no floor it runs ADVISORY: it prints the
measured tokens/sec and exits 0, so the first Studio run yields the number to
review. Enforcement turns on only when a floor is supplied via ``--min-tps`` or
``$RAPID_MLX_PERF_MIN_TPS`` (set it to the reviewed number, e.g. ~85% of the
observed warm rate to absorb run-to-run variance).

Usage
-----
    # advisory (prints tokens/sec, always exits 0):
    python evals/perf_gate.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1

    # enforcing (fails if below the reviewed floor):
    RAPID_MLX_PERF_MIN_TPS=19.5 python evals/perf_gate.py

Exit codes:
    0 — measured tokens/sec >= floor, OR advisory mode (no floor set)
    1 — a floor was set and the measured tokens/sec fell below it (regression)
    2 — no server reachable, or the response lacked usable token accounting

    Dividing total request latency by token count — which this gate used to
    do — charges prefill and time-to-first-token against decode, so a long
    prompt makes a healthy model look slow (512 tokens with 10s TTFT + 20s
    decode reports 17 tok/s for a model actually decoding at 25.6). vLLM and
    SGLang both report TTFT and output-token throughput as separate numbers
    for exactly this reason; measure decode the same way, from the first
    streamed token to the last.

    Token COUNT comes from ``usage.completion_tokens`` via
    ``stream_options.include_usage``, not from counting SSE frames: one delta
    is not one token (the detokenizer can batch several, and a frame can
    carry no text at all), so frame-counting silently understates throughput.
